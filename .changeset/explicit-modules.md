**BREAKING**: Modules own their definitions. Pass `workflow({ definitions: [checkout] })` / `agent({ definitions: [...] })` instead of a top-level `definitions` list on `createLooms`, `createRuntime`, actor cells/hosts, or Durable Objects. Omitting `modules` installs none (no longer defaults to agent/workflow/approval).

**BREAKING**: `defineModule(options, setup)` returns the finished module. Returned `effects` / `threads` / `projections` / `definitions` are registered and exposed (e.g. `payments.effects.charge`). The old scope-only + `.build()` form is replaced by `createModuleScope` for multi-file authoring.

Compose rejects duplicate definitions and definitions whose owning module does not implement the thread kind. Starting or spawning an unsupported kind fails before run events are written; folding an unsupported kind marks the thread failed instead of inventing empty state.
