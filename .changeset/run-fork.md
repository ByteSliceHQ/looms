`looms.fork(runId)`, `POST /runs/:id/fork`, and `client.fork()` start a new run that continues where a failed or cancelled run stopped. The fork copies the source's history up to the point it finished, keeping thread ids and sequence numbers, records `runtime.run.forked`, and re-issues the effects outstanding there. A cancelled agent re-runs the model call the cancel cut off; a failed run retries the effect whose failure ended it. Effects can declare `deterministic: true` so a fork retries the work behind them instead; workflow scheduling does. Forking a missing run rejects with `RunNotFoundError` (404 over HTTP). Actor and Durable Object hosts return 501. The debugger shows Continue on failed and cancelled runs, and `useRunSummary` reports `resumable` for them.

`runtime.thread.cancelled` records `resumeSeq` on the thread a cancel targeted: the run's last seq before the cancellation began.
