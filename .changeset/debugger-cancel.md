`POST /runs/:id/cancel` and `client.cancel(runId, threadId?)` cancel a run or thread over HTTP. The debugger's Cancel button now uses it, so cancelling an in-flight agent turn stops the run instead of retrying the turn. Cancel stays available while a wake is running. `POST /runs/:id/wake` and `client.wake()` return `appended`, the number of events the run gained during the wake, and the debugger's Wake button reports it. Client run tables, the debugger, and projector indexes now mark a cancelled run as `cancelled` instead of `running`, and projector indexes mark a run that completed with an error as `failed` instead of `completed`. `RunRow.status` and `RunSummary.status` are typed as `RunStatus`, and `completedRunStatus()` reads the outcome of a `runtime.run.completed` payload.

Signals sent to a completed, failed, or cancelled run now reject with `RunTerminalError` (HTTP 409) instead of being appended and ignored. Retrying a signal whose `idempotencyKey` was already accepted still succeeds. `useRunSummary` exposes `finished`, and the debugger disables the agent follow-up composer and approval decisions on finished runs.
