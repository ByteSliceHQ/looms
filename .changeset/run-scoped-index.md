The projector index is keyed by run, so runs that share thread or approval ids stay apart. `getActor(runId, actorId?)` returns the run row by default or one of its threads, review rows carry `runId` instead of `actorId`, and the tables are now `looms_run_actors` and `looms_run_reviews`. The built-in index projectors moved to version 2, so delivery rebuilds them; the old `looms_actors` and `looms_reviews` tables are no longer written.
